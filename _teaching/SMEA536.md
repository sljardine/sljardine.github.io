Applied Microeconomics for Marine Affairs: This course provides a survey of environmental economics, including: the efficiency criterion for environmental policy, when markets yield suboptimal environmental outcomes, correcting suboptimal outcomes with market instruments and alternative policy approaches. The course also touches on methods for valuing environmental goods and services and cost-benefit analysis. The course is expected to stimulate critical thinking about current environmental challenges and policies designed to overcome them.
