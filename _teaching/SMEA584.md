This course covers the basics of data analysis with applications to marine and environmental policy. Course objectives include: (1) fostering an understanding of the importance of data analysis in environmental and marine policy; (2) learning how to calculate basic statistics; (3) learning how to conduct hypothesis tests with and without statistical controls; (4) developing an understanding for the properties and limitations of various datasets; and (5) learning how to critique data-based claims; understanding identication issues as they relate to environmental and marine policy. The course balances producing statistical analysis, where students work to clean, visualize, and analyze a single dataset, with consuming statistics, where students read and critique peer-reviewed empirical work.
