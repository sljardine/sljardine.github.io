# SMEA 584: Statistics for Marine and Environmental Policy

University of Washington, School of Marine and Environmental Affairs, Fall 2016-Fall 2020


This course covers the basics of data analysis with applications to marine and environmental policy. Course objectives include: (1) fostering an understanding of the importance of data analysis in environmental and marine policy; (2) learning how to calculate basic statistics; (3) learning how to conduct hypothesis tests with and without statistical controls; (4) developing an understanding for the properties and limitations of various datasets; and (5) learning how to critique data-based claims; understanding identication issues as they relate to environmental and marine policy. The course balances producing statistical analysis, where students work to clean, visualize, and analyze a single dataset, with consuming statistics, where students read and critique peer-reviewed empirical work.


# SMEA 536: Applied Microeconomics for Marine Affairs

University of Washington, School of Marine and Environmental Affairs, Winter 2017-Winter 2021

This course provides a survey of environmental economics, including: the efficiency criterion for environmental policy, when markets yield suboptimal environmental outcomes, correcting suboptimal outcomes with market instruments and alternative policy approaches. The course also touches on methods for valuing environmental goods and services and cost-benefit analysis. The course is expected to stimulate critical thinking about current environmental challenges and policies designed to overcome them.


# SMEA 550: Spatial Data Workshop

University of Washington, School of Marine and Environmental Affairs, Spring 2018-Spring 2021

This course provides an introduction to available technologies for programatic spatial data manipulation and visualization using the R software environment. While the focus is on technology, tips for good map making are interspersed throughout the class and will be provided in the required readings. The course content is intended to be dynamic and responsive to student-led projects.
