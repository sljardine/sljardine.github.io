<p>&nbsp; </p>

I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Marine and Environmental Affairs](https://smea.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). I am also faculty in the [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management](https://quantitative.uw.edu) program. 

My research is broadly focused on the economics of conservation and management in marine and coastal systems. My current research topics include the economics of harmful algal blooms, user investments fishery value and abundance, and salmon conservation planning.
