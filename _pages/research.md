## Harmful Algal Blooms

In the 2015/2016 fishing season, managers shut down the California Dungeness crab fishery in response to an unprescendented harmful algal bloom (HABs) event. Impacts include reduced harvest, [reduced ex-vessel prices](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/707643), [shifts in the distribution of fishing revenue towards large vessels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800919312935), [shifts in fishing portfolios](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2014379117), and [disruptions to community traditions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988320300792). As climate change is expected to increase the occurence of HAB events, it is important to explore policies that can mitigate the impacts from HABs.

## Investments in the Commons

</p>

The dominant narrative of open access resources is one of a lack of stewardship incentives leading to overexploitation. While a good description of fundamental drivers in these systems, the current dialogue almost entirely ignores real-world complexities surrounding observed investments that resource users make in improving resource value and sustainability. Examples include investment in [marketing seafood products](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1093/ajae/aau050) and in [stocking fish harvested under recreational open access](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art16/).  I am interested in understanding the economic incentives for investment in the commons, and the biological and socioeconomic outcomes of these investments. 


## Salmon Conservation

Migratory anadromous salmon and steelhead native to Western Washington (*Oncorhynchus spp.*) rely on access to streams throughout their spawning and rearing phases of their complex life cycles. Barriers to fish passage, particularly poorly-designed culverts at road crossings, prevent fish from accessing potential habitat, hampering recovery efforts for declining populations, and violating tribal treaty rights. In the 2021-2023 biennium, rougly $750 million dollars will be spent restoring state-owned culverts in Washinton and millions more will be spent on culverts owned by cities, counties, and other parties. I am interested in exploring opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of these investments.
